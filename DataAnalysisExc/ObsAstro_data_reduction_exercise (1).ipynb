    "Today you will determine the spectral type of a faint companion by comparing the flux of the primary star to the secondary companion and then deriving the Methane Spectral Index (MSI), which is a measure of the amount of methane detected in the companion.  This data was taken at the Very Large Telescope using the NaCo SDI camera to image a binary that consists of a very low mass star with a brown dwarf companion.  This particular brown dwarf is very cool and has a \"T\" spectral type -- characterised by deep methane absorption features.  We can use the depth of these methane absorption features to estimate a rough spectral type for this brown dwarf.  We will use the jupyter notebook, which allows us to run interactive data analysis in python from within a browser window to do so.  To run each code box, press the play button in the toolbox. "
