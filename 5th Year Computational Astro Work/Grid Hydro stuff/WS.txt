The aim of Practice Workshop 1:

(a), to reproduce Table 2.1, p.45. Compare and analyse how three difference
approximations to the first derivative yield different accuracies and
orders of convergence.  

All Tables and Figures refer to the book Numerical Methods in
Astrophysics, by P.Bodenheimer et al. The plots and table need not
have the identical layout as the plots in the book, but the content
should be equivalent.  

-----------------------

Use a combination of 
(1) a programming language of your choice for the numerical calculations,  
(2) a plotting package or graphics commands within a language to produce the plots and 
(3) typesetting or editing software to give an explanation in text form of your working.   

Examples for
(1) C, fortran, matlab, maple, idl, java, python
(2) matlab, maple, idl, gnuplot
(3) TeX, word, Maple, emacs

Please produce a self-contained report document, including explanatory
text with embedded or appended figures, as pdf file.  

Submit all your work (codes, plots, text) electronically in Learn, on
the page "Lecture Notes / Grid-Based Hydrodynamics". 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

If time, try

(b) to reproduce Figure 2.2, p.47. Compare and analyse how the three
approximations of part (a), when applied to a simple ordinary differential
equation, yield different accuracies of the solution. Hint: rewrite
the implicit schemes to avoid having to solve a set of linear equations.  

Note typo: Eq.(2.28) shows that epsilon is calculated from u-w, so the
relative error shown in Fig.2.2 should be epsilon/w, not epsilon/u.
