The aim of Practice Workshop 2:

continue and finish
(b) to reproduce Figure 2.2, p.47. Compare and analyse how the three approximations of
part (a), when applied to a simple ordinary differential equation, yield
different accuracies of the solution. Hint: rewrite the implicit schemes to
avoid having to solve a set of linear equations. 

Note typo: Eq.(2.28) shows that epsilon is calculated from u-w, so the
relative error shown in Fig.2.2 should be epsilon/w, not epsilon/u.

(c) to programme scheme (2.57), to reproduce Figure 2.10 (p.63), and
to investigate, compare and analyse the numerical viscosity of that scheme. 

Where appropriate use an even number of grid points for the spatial
zoning. Staggered grids are not necessary.
