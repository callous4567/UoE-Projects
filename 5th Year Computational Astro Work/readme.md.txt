SPH Stuff has some basic stuff done for the SPH portion- just setting up an SPH particle set and some density interpolation functions/mass summation.
Uses Gauss Kernel, etc. Nothing fancy.

Grid Hydro Stuff has some basic grid simulation things, including some fully-coded copies of certain figures from Bodenheimers Computational Physics.
The figures come from Section 2- rather proud of how close I got to replicating them (insets and all.)
The PDF enclosed has full information relating to this work including rather conclusive discussions on errors with the differencing methods used.
(I did that folder all in one sitting so there might be a few errors related to me staying up until noon the next morning.)
