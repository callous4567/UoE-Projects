Hey! Thanks for opening the readme. Probably the first person who ever has.

Anyways.

There are four folders. Each one is what it is: NitroRun is the run for N_2 without spin. SpinNitroRun has spin. You can figure out the rest on that front.

Each folder contains the program to be run. Particle3D.py is the particle class file. MorseyGorsey is the simulator/etc.
They're both a bit esoteric, but my random coomments should help a bit.

I've configured the optimal max time to use for each. Other than that, they're identical programs.

The data in the folders is the data used. You can generate it straight-up with the configurations already in the files.

Thanks for reading!
