# Modelling and Visualization Directory
Poorly labelled (since I mistook it as "Simulation and Visualization! lol. Here you'll find the work I produce(d) for the three checkpoints afforded by this course. 

## C1 
The two-dimensional Ising model, with both Glauber and Kawasaki Dynamics, sped up by Numba, with various graphing (and video-producing) utilities. You'll get science, you'll get video, what more can you want???!?!??!?!P£LK%R"O$K£6t

## C1_2
Very quick and dirty edit of C1, not graded, to simulate the 2D XY Model (which is a vector-version of the 2D Ising Film.)
