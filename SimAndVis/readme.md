# Modelling and Visualization Directory
Poorly labelled (since I mistook it as "Simulation and Visualization! lol. Here you'll find the work I produce(d) for the three checkpoints afforded by this course. 

## C1 
The two-dimensional Ising model, with both Glauber and Kawasaki Dynamics, sped up by Numba, with various graphing (and video-producing) utilities. Video examples are linked.

## C1_2
Very quick and dirty edit of C1, **not graded**, to simulate the 2D XY Model (which is a vector-version of the 2D Ising Film.) Video examples linked. Quiver plotting with first-order gaussian-convolved divergence maps demonstrating vorticity. Phase plotting (0,2pi) demonstrating transitions. etc.
