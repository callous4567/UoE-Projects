# UoE-Projects

## Holds all/most of the coding I've done so far at the UoE for my 5-year integrated MSc in Physics w/ Astrophysyics.##

This includes code for the:

### 2nd Year Programming & Data Analysis (Basic/random/etc stuff. First time coding too!! (The nostalgia my god) 

### 3rd Year Observational Astronomy Labs (Spectroscopy of discharge tubes + also the solo work from 1st Semester/etc) 

### 3rd Year Computer Modelling (Solo + Group, note that the N-Body simulation code is the work of one of my group-mates + has been removed. Sorry :/) 

### 4th Year Telescope Group Project (Star Clusters Project) 

### 5th Year Computational Astrophysics, Python Modelling and Visualization (tbd) courses, alongside MPhys (tbd, data redacted) 
*Mphys is "master-streams" and is currently WIP- note that if you use this code, you should make sure to give me credit in some part... :/* 

Disclaimer: a lot of it is dirty/as-it-was-after-ending-the-work
What student cleans up their code after the fact? Not this one.
Granted, I do intend to go back + clean up the 4th year TGP stuff over summer to make it complete from scratch. That stuff is my pride and joy.
Anyway, I'll update this readme if I do, I won't update it if I don't.
ENJOY! <3
