# UoE-Projects

Also known as Sebastian Straszak's Amazing Attempt At Assuaging All About A Revelation- that he knows how to code. 
I know, amazing- if you told me five years ago I'd know how to program, I'd have laughed. Well, here' we are.

*No seriously though* You'll be finding all the code I ever made during my time here at Edinburgh University 
doing "Physics with Astrophysics" as an MPhys program. They are ordered by the year they were done in, roughly, except for special cases.


## Codebases

### Second Year

The first scraps of my programming experience. Dirty little scraps. Rather nasty ones. 

### Third Year 

Not-so-scrappy scraps, including my first efforts with simulation (diatomic atoms) and spectrum analysis, for the labs.

### Fourth Year 

The good stuff. The cream of the crop. Some of my finest... mostly!

- SHP Stuff includes my SHons thesis, a 1D simulation of scalar field cosmology. 
- Telescope Group Project, which includes the largest (not so refined) body of code I've ever written, and **has its own readme.** 

### Fifth Year 

The best of the best- the slickest of the slick! I'll admit, I'm getting there! 

- Computational Astrophysics course- has grid-hydrodynamic codes and some stuff for perfecetly replicating graphs from literature (this is the bit I am proud of- the effort with Matplotlib!)
- SimAndVis has the "Modelling and Visualization" course. My best of all! Game of Life, SIRS, 2D Ising Model, XY Ising Model... the list goes on and on! **Has its own readme.**
- master-streams, aka my MSc Thesis! The finest most refined bit of code. Tears to my eyes I swear. It also **has its own readme** which I recommend.

## Some notes from myself

Lots of this code was left as-is. If another student finds it useful, they'll find it useful. 
If you are that other student, I hope you find it usefulf! 
Feel free to contact me for any help you may need.

I have to add, ***this page tracks the chronology of my programming journey thus far.*** 2nd year? Hah. Third? I might have learned 
what "Object Oriented" meant, but still hah. Fourth? I suppose it's gotten alright. Fifth? Average. *I know I'm not a great programmer. I use Python for gods sake!*

Take care and enjoy! :D :D :D
