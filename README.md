# UoE-Projects has all the code (or most of it) that I write for my Uni of Edinburgh Astrophys degree.

# Feel free to use it or whatever. I'm not going to support any of it once it's here.

# There's stuff here for:
# - Analysing ThorLabs spectrum CSV files (CCS200) & fitting peaks/troughs
# - Blackbody curve fitting of ThorLabs spectra  
# - Random exercises from Programming & Data Analysis, Computer Modelling, Computer Simulation courses at University of Edinburgh
# - N-Body siimulation of Solar System 
# - 3D Ellipse Generator w/ Noise
# - Ellipse Fitting Program
# - Automatic photometry program for datacubes

# If you need any help with any of the code here I won't do it, it is what it is. Anyway hope you find it useful.
