# UoE-Projects

## Holds all/most of the coding I've done so far at the UoE for my 5-year integrated MSc in Physics w/ Astrophysyics.##

This includes code for the:

### 2nd Year Programming & Data Analysis (Basic/random/etc stuff. First time coding too!! (The nostalgia my god) 

### 3rd Year Observational Astronomy Labs (Spectroscopy of discharge tubes + also the solo work from 1st Semester/etc) 

### 3rd Year Computer Modelling (Solo + Group, note that the N-Body simulation code is the work of one of my group-mates + has been removed. Sorry :/) 

### 4th Year Telescope Group Project (Star Clusters Project) 

### 5th Year Computational Astrophysics (Mostly Grid Hydrodynamics)

### 5th Year Python Modelling and Visualization (under SimVis) ONGOING !!!

### 5th Year MSc Project _with data redacted_ (under master-streams) ONGOING !!!

Disclaimer: a lot of it is dirty/as-it-was-after-ending-the-work
What student cleans up their code after the fact? Not this one.
**Only the 4th Year TGP Code and basically all 5th Year Code is of reasonable quality. The rest is just here as reference for some niche usages.**

Disclaimer for any UoE students hoping to rip code from here to use without putting effort in: good luck. If there's one single thing I have been marked down for, it's comments. Make that two: formatting. I do not adhere to PEP or anything like that (unless it's collaborative code) and so, GOD SPEED! :D :D :D
