# Senior Honours Project: Scalar Fields and the Lambda-CDM Inflationary Cosmology

This code, which is dirty and left as it was when I finished, contains codes for 1D PDE simulations
of the LCDM Universe, where Lambda has been replaced by a scalar field. The goal of this project was to investigate how such a field reduces the anthropic limitations and
fine-tuning limitations of the LCDM cosmology for our Universe.

**There isn't much else to add to this readme if I'm being honest- this is just the code I used for that project. 
To be fair, it did go well, so the code must have been fine! :)**
