# Changing out the galactocentric conversion currently present
"""
Take ASCII data
Remove Galcentric (i.e. recover ICRS) using Jorge's coordinates
Retrieve Galcentric using our coordinates (updated ones)

# ICRS/etc

Leveraging re-obtained ICRS, re-obtain Galactic Coordinates, too.

# Coordinates of all stars (and their velocities) are all done.
